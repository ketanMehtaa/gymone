I'll help you create a strategic approach to selling your web app to gym management. Let's break this down into key areas:

Understanding Your Target Audience:
First, gym managers and owners typically care about:
- Increasing membership retention and revenue
- Reducing administrative workload
- Managing staff schedules efficiently
- Tracking equipment maintenance
- Monitoring membership usage patterns
- Managing member communications

Approach Strategy:
1. Research and Preparation
   - Visit local gyms to understand their current systems
   - Identify specific pain points in their operations
   - Prepare case studies or data showing how your app solves these problems

2. Sales Pitch Structure
   Focus on benefits, not just features:
   - Lead with their biggest pain point (e.g., "How much time does your staff spend on scheduling and member management?")
   - Demonstrate how your app directly saves time/money
   - Show concrete examples of how other gyms benefit
   - Include ROI calculations (time saved Ã— staff hourly rate)

3. Communication Channels
   - Direct outreach via LinkedIn to gym owners/managers
   - Attend fitness industry trade shows
   - Partner with gym equipment suppliers
   - Create targeted ads on industry-specific platforms

4. Objection Handling:
   Be ready for common concerns:
   - Cost: Focus on ROI and offer a free trial period
   - Training time: Emphasize user-friendly interface and support
   - Data migration: Offer assistance in transitioning from old systems
   - Security: Explain your data protection measures

5. Demonstration Strategy:
   - Offer live demos focused on their specific needs
   - Create a short video showing key features
   - Provide a sandbox environment for them to test
   - Show mobile accessibility if available

6. Follow-up Plan:
   - Send personalized proposals after meetings
   - Offer limited-time introductory pricing
   - Provide references from other gym clients
   - Regular check-ins during trial periods
